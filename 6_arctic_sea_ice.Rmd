### Explore NOAA Arctic sea ice data

- Data website <http://nsidc.org/data/G02135>
- Raw data from <ftp://sidads.colorado.edu/DATASETS/NOAA/G02135/north/daily/data/N_seaice_extent_daily_v3.0.csv>

The Sea Ice Index provides a quick look at Arctic- and Antarctic-wide changes in long-term sea ice cover derived from satellite data. By reading the User Guide, we can learn that **the Sea Ice Index gives the sea ice extent (areal coverage) in units of million km^2 derived from satellite measurements**. The "Missing" data gives the extent of the area where data was not available in units of a million km^2. Let's download, read and plot the daily sea ice extent in the Northern Hemisphere.  

```{r}
# arctic_ice = read.csv("data/N_seaice_extent_daily_v3.0.csv", skip=2, header = FALSE, col.names = c("Year", "Month", "Day", "Extent", "Missing", "Source_Data"))
url = 'ftp://sidads.colorado.edu/DATASETS/NOAA/G02135/north/daily/data/N_seaice_extent_daily_v3.0.csv'
arctic_ice = read.delim(url, skip=2, sep=",", header=FALSE, col.names = c("Year", "Month", "Day", "Extent", "Missing", "Source_Data"))
tail(arctic_ice)
```

Notice that unlike in previous data sets, the date information is split into three columns: year, month, day. This will make it harder to plot a time series since we can only plot one variable along the x axis. We could do the math to turn the month and day variables into decimal dates. Another, simpler, option is to take advantage of the `lubridate` package that was designed by other R users. Installing, loading and using functions from R packages can save you loads of time and dramatically increase the functionality of the R language. We will use many other packages throughout the course.

First, we need to install the `lubridate` package from the CRAN library. You can do this in RStudio using the top menu: `Tools -> Install packages...`. Then type the name of the package you want (lubridate) into the text box, make sure the `Install Dependencies` box is checked and click `Install`. Or you can simply do it at your command line with the function `install.packages("lubridate")`. Once installed, you need to load the package functions into your environment with the `library()` function. Now that the `lubridate` package is loaded up, we can use the function `make_date()` to transform your year, month and day into a `date` type variable. Don't forget you can use the command `?make_date` to find out more about the function (or just search for the function in the Help tab of the lower left panel in RStudio).

```{r}
# install.packages("lubridate")
library("lubridate")  # make_date()

arctic_ice$date = make_date(arctic_ice$Year, arctic_ice$Month, arctic_ice$Day)
plot(Extent ~ date, data=arctic_ice, ylab="Arctic sea ice extent (x10^6 km^2)", type='l') 
```

Use for loops to calculate the annual average Arctic sea ice extent and the 5-year-average Arctic sea ice extent. The annual average is the mean of all of the sea ice extent observations within a given year. We'll define the 5-year-average ice extent for some given year `x` as the mean of all sea ice exten observations within the year `x` as well as the 2 years prior and the 2 years after year `x`. For example, the 5-year-average sea ice extent for 2010 is the mean of all observations from Jan. 1 2008 to Dec. 31 2012.

```{r}
# Dump the first year (since it's not complete!)
# Dump the most recent year (since it's not complete!)
arctic_ice_averages = data.frame(Year=seq(min(arctic_ice$Year)+1, max(arctic_ice$Year)-1), extent_annual_avg=NA, extent_5yr_avg=NA)
head(arctic_ice_averages)

# Hard-coding vs. indexing the years:
arctic_ice$Extent[arctic_ice$Year == 1979] # Find the daily data for the first year
mean(arctic_ice$Extent[arctic_ice$Year == 1979]) # Calculate mean of the daily data for the first year
arctic_ice_averages$extent_annual_avg[1] = mean(arctic_ice$Extent[arctic_ice$Year == arctic_ice_averages$Year[1]]) # calc and store mean extent for that first year (without hard coding year)

# calculate annual average:
for (i in seq(dim(arctic_ice_averages)[1]))
{
  arctic_ice_averages$extent_annual_avg[i] = mean(arctic_ice$Extent[arctic_ice$Year == arctic_ice_averages$Year[i]])
}

# 5-year average:
for (i in seq(3, dim(arctic_ice_averages)[1]-2)) # skip the first 2 and last 2 years
{
  years = c((arctic_ice_averages$Year[i]-2):(arctic_ice_averages$Year[i]+2))
  arctic_ice_averages$extent_5yr_avg[i] = mean(arctic_ice$Extent[arctic_ice$Year %in% years])
}

head(arctic_ice_averages)

# pdf('figures/arctic_ice_extent.pdf', width=7, height=5)
plot(extent_annual_avg ~ Year, data=arctic_ice_averages, col="red", type="l") +
  lines(extent_5yr_avg ~ Year, data=arctic_ice_averages, col="blue", type="l")
# dev.off()
```

As you'd expect, the 5-year-average really smooths out some of that year-to-year variability and makes it a bit easier to observe the overall trend through time. 

If we want to plot the annual and 5-year averages on the same plot as the original observations, we'll have to change our `Year` variable into a `date`-type variable that will plot nicely along the dates in the original observation dataset:

``` {r}
#To plot the annual and 5-year averages on the same plot as the original observations:
# arctic_ice_annual$date = as.Date(paste(arctic_ice_annual$Year, 1, 1, sep = "-")) # as.Date is in base R
arctic_ice_averages$date = make_date(year=arctic_ice_averages$Year) # default month and day = 1
# arctic_ice_annual$date = make_date(year=arctic_ice_annual$Year, month=7, day=1) # set to middle of year
plot(Extent ~ date, data=arctic_ice, ylab="Arctic sea ice extent (x10^6 km^2)", type='l') +
  lines(extent_annual_avg ~ date, data=arctic_ice_averages, col="red") +
  lines(extent_5yr_avg ~ date, data=arctic_ice_averages, col="blue")
```

Now, let's calculate the observed rate of change in annually averaged ice extent across the time period by subtracting the first average Arctic ice extent area from the most recent average Arctic ice extent area, and dividing by the number of years of observation:

```{r}
# ice_loss_million_km2 = arctic_ice_averages$extent_annual_avg[arctic_ice_averages$Year==2022] - arctic_ice_averages$extent_annual_avg[arctic_ice_averages$Year==1979]
ice_loss_million_km2 = arctic_ice_averages$extent_annual_avg[dim(arctic_ice_averages)[1]] - arctic_ice_averages$extent_annual_avg[1]
time_period = max(arctic_ice_averages$Year) - min(arctic_ice_averages$Year)

# Calc rate of ice loss:
ice_loss_million_km2_per_yr = ice_loss_million_km2 / time_period
```

So from 1978 to 2021, we have lost 1,658,980 km^2 of ice extent in the Arctic. That's about the size of Alaska!

### Exercise 6.1

Use a for loop to calculate the total ice loss in each full decade of the data, starting with 1980-1989. Plot the ice loss per decade in a bar plot.
